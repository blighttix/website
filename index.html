    <h3>"i have no idea who you're yapping about"</h3>
    <h4><em>(said the hypothetical person)</em></h4>
    <p>That's a wonderful question. Shadow the Hedgehog is basically the opposite of <a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog" target="_blank">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>; dark, sharp, and reserved (with a dash of some strange morals and amnesia). </p>
    <p>Basically, SEGA wanted to make a sequel to their last best-seller with a team of 'villains', and they did that. (and added in this guy)</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h3><em>Adventure 1 and the Dreamcast</em></h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Dreamcast-Console-Set.jpg/1200px-Dreamcast-Console-Set.jpg" alt="Dreamcast" class="dreamcast">
    <p>The first Sonic Adventure game was what SEGA hoped would let the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast#">Dreamcast</a> keep up with other companies' consoles. (they sorta kinda failed in that aspect, but hey! it was a good game!) Sonic Adventure was the first game of its franchise to be fully 3D, and was the start of a more mature era of Sonic games. It was also much more story-based than previous releases, which has had a lasting effect on the franchise.</p>

    <h3><em>Concept</em></h3>
    <img src="https://sonic-city.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Terios_Test0.jpg" alt="Terios concept" class="terios">
    <p>In concept, Shadow is meant to be just a darker version of Sonic, both visually and in the story. In fact, the first name developed for the character was Terios, a name that translates to "reflection of." (a reflection of Sonic!) This contrast was meant to appeal to a new American audience, with the 'anti-hero' trope being quite popular at the time.</p>

    <h2 class="center">General Knowledge</h2>
    <h3 class="center"><em>Backstory</em></h3>
    <p>Shadow's story has been recently expanded upon with the 2024 "Year of Shadow." Shadow the Hedgehog is a military weapon that was created with the intention on healing his creator's grandaughter, Maria Robotnik. In order for him to be created, Gerald Robotnik uses DNA from the alien Black Arms, along with that of a hedgehog. Shadow and Maria form a friendship during their time together, but it is cut short when Maria is shot. In her final moments, the sends Shadow away in an escape pod.</p>
    <p>When Shadow's body is eventually recovered by the goverment agency G.U.N., he is immediately placed into stasis for an unkown amount of time due to the fear of his power; chaos energy. Eventually, he is broken out by Gerald's grandson Ivo (otherwise known as Eggman). They then embark on a mission to destroy the world! How fun! During this, though, Shadow realizes that doing so would disrespect Maria's memory, and so he teams up with Sonic to save the world, and succeed in doing so.</p>
    <p><em>After the events of Sonic Adventure 2, Shadow was originally supposed to die, but Sonic Team and SEGA brought him back, as he became very popular among the fanbase.</em></p>

    <p>He's been in other games too, but those are mostly spinoffs or mentions/cameos of his character; nothing that's especially important to his story.</p>
